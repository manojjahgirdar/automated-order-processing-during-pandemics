# AI Powered Order Processing during Pandemics

- We propose a toll-free number (ex :- dial *222) based approach to contact control tower with AI backend system. Here the user will be able to call toll free number and order the essentials. This will address the limitation mentioned above and will have wider reach with the population to make use of the facility.

- We also propose creating an online portal to connect with the control tower that accepts the online orders of daily essentials/medicines, which would be controlled by the government retail entity (Government of commerce and industry). Online mode can take requests through text or manually selecting through the cart. 

- This way we are enabling people to either place orders online or offline mode which will help manage the traffic.

## Offline Approach using Watson Knowledge Studio

- The conversation between the User and Automatic call responder(Bot) will be recorded.

- These audio recordings are feed as an input to the authorized portal to place orders.

- Watson services is configured to extract required details from the audio recording and send them to inventory database maintained by admin.

Advantage :

Since majority of Indian population (specially elderly population and rural population) do not have knowledge about digital services, they will not be able to use the available online portals to order daily essentials & medicines. Hence this approach will not only address this limitation but also solve the issue of hectic manual work, since the backend is automated.

## Online Approach with Watson Assistant

- Provide a chatbot on the authorized portal where the citizen can interact with Watson.

- Watson Assistant can be configured to identify intents and provide with dynamic responses.

- Watson Assistant can capture the details from the user and send them to inventory database which will be maintained by the admin.

Advantage : 

Online Approach will be extremely helpful for the Urban population. Online mode can take requests through text or manually selecting through the cart. 

## Conclusion

In the above methods, the backend system is automated and equipped to handle the volume of queries efficiently. The above methods (offline & online) highlight the assurance of two important things. One is the stability of the system/control tower to manage the volume of orders in an automated way eliminating human interference and second is the delivery of supplies from the government entities thereby governing the social distancing measures, demand & supply management & empowering the citizens to avail the supplies at their doorstep.

### Results

- Social distancing achieved through streamlined process.

- Government has control over the quality & price of food items and hygiene of the delivery volunteer.

- Enable elderly & other people to get necessary supplies. People under lockdown need not worry about daily essentials.

- Works without Internet as well. You just need a mobile/telephone to order using toll free number.

- Backend is efficient and fast because of automation & caters to offline & online mode of orders.

- This will solve the problem of addressing panic among residents and ensure continuous availability of the products.

- The control tower will enable governments to guide and regulate the implementation of its directives to a great extent.
